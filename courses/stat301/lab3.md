= data-x='2000'
# Important Concepts
- Mean
  - Take the average
- Median
  - Sort the data from smallest to largest
  - If n is odd, median is the center observation
  - If n is even, median is the mean of the two center observations


---
= data-x='3000'
# Important Concepts
- Quartiles
  - Sort the data from smallest to largest, and find the median
  - The first quartile Q1 is the median of data to the left of median
  - The third quartile Q3 is the median of data to the right of median
  - Calculate quartiles by hand, not SPSS

= data-x='4000'
# Important Concepts
- Skewness
  - Skewed left: Long **Tail** on the left
  - Skewed right: Long **Tail** on the right
- Modes
  - Unimodal: One major peak
  - Multimodal: More than one peaks

= data-x='4000' data-y='1000' data-rotate=90
# Choosing a Summary
- Five-number summary
  - Skewed distribution, or with outliers
- Mean and standard deviation
  - Symmetric, free of outliers

= data-x='1000'
# Reminder
- **Contribute your data in the front**
- Pick up handout and your previous lab sheet
- Open Blackboard and download SPSS instructions
- Slides at http://statr.me/courses.html
- Don't need to do #8
- You need to print off graphs for this lab

# Types of Variables
- Quantitative variable
  - Takes **numerical** values
  - Can have **arithmetic** operations, such as adding and averaging
  - Example: age, height, temperature, etc.
- Categorical variable
  - Places an individual into one of several **groups** or **categories**
  - Example: colour, major, etc.

# Graphing Tools
- Quantitative variable
  - Histogram, Stemplot, etc.
- Categorical variable
  - Bar Graph, Pie Graph, etc.

= data-x='3000'
# Entering Data
- Change variable type to **string** for categorical variable
- Two ways to enter categorical data
  - Enter value sequentially as it is (Left)
  - Enter summarized values and their counts (Right)

# Entering Data
- For the second approach, remember to **WEIGHT CASES**
- Read instructions carefully

# Distribution Shapes
- Skewness
  - Skewed left: Long **Tail** on the left
  - Skewed right: Long **Tail** on the right
- Modes
  - Unimodal: One major peak
  - Multimodal: More than one peaks

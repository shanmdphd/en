# Some Unhappy Truth
- **NO** make-up labs
- You **NEED** to get prepared - you don't have time to re-study everything
- Finish and turn in your lab before the end of the session. **NO** late hand-in allowed
- Focus on your work during the lab. **NO** texting/email/Facebook. Time is money, and your score.

# Sampling design
- Simple random samples (SRS)
  - Each individual has an equal chance to be selected.
- Stratified samples
  - Divide population into groups, and then choose an SRS from each group.

# Hints on problems
- #1 & #2: Write down the results for #1 when you get an SRS, and calculate sample mean for #2 before taking the next sample.
- #7: Graphs => Legacy Dialogs => Histogram
- #8: **BEFORE** calculating the population mean, delete the filter column first. (Select column, right click, and choose "Clear")

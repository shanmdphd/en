## Lab 12: Analysis of Two-Way Tables
## T.A.: Yixuan Qiu

= data-x='1000'
# Two-Way Table
- Studies the association between two **categorical** variables
![](crosstable.png)



---
= data-x='2000'
# Percentage Table
- Divide each cell by the total count
![](percentage.png)



---
= data-x='3000' data-y='1000' data-rotate=90
# Joint, Marginal and Conditional Percentages 
- Joint: percentage of a combination of the two factors
- Marginal: percentage of a single factor
- Conditional: percentage of a single factor given that we know
the value of the other factor



---
= data-x='3000' data-y='1000' data-rotate=90
# Example
- What percentage of students have low physical activity and high fruit consumption?
![](percentage1.png)



---
= data-x='3000' data-y='1000' data-rotate=90
# Example
- What percentage of students have moderate physical activity?
![](percentage2.png)



---
= data-x='3000' data-y='1000' data-rotate=90
# Example
- What percentage of students have low fruit consumption within the group of moderate physical activity?
  - 17.4% / 37.4% = 46.5%

---
= data-x='4000'
# The Chi-square Test
- Test whether the two factors have association
![](chisq.test.png)



---
= data-x='5000'
# Condition to Use Chi-square Test
- For tables larger than 2x2
  - The average of the expected counts is 5 or more and the smallest expected count is 1 or more

- For 2x2 tables
  - All 4 expected cell counts are 5 or more



---
= data-x='6000'
# Enter Data in SPSS
- Remember to do the **WEIGHT CASES**

# Last Words
- Thank you all for coming to this lab
- You are all **GREAT**!

# SPSS Tips
- When you enter categorical variables into SPSS, you must specify the type as **string** in variable view.
- **Only** enter the variable I specify for #5-6 and #7-8.
- For #5-6, enter the **original data**, i.e., one column.
- For #7-8, enter the **summarized data**, one column for names of categories, another column for counts. Make sure to **weight cases**.
- Copy the graph for #5 into Word document **before** doing #6. Same with #7-8.

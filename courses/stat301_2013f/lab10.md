= data-x='2000'
# Scatterplot
- Study the relationship between two quantitative variables.

---
= data-x='3000'
# Scatterplot
- Form: linear or non-linear?
- Direction: positive or negative?
- Strength: strong or weak?
- Outliers?



---
= data-x='3000' data-y='1000' data-rotate=90
# Linear Regression
- Find a straight line to fit the relationship between $X$ and $Y$
- Also used to predict $Y$ for a given $X$

---
= data-x='4000'
# Regression Equation
- $\hat{y}=b\_0+b\_1 x$

= data-x='5000'
# Check the Assumptions
- Data coming from SRS
- Variables linearly related (Scatterplot)
- Normality of $Y$ (PP-plot)
- Same standard deviation at all $X$ values (Residual plot)



---
= data-x='6000'
# PP-plot

---
= data-x='6000'
# Residual Plot
- Residual = $y$ - $\hat{y}$

= data-x='6000'
# Correction
- 11: The first question should be
  
  "Do the points follow the 45-degree angle line?"

I'm Yixuan Qiu, currently a third-year PhD student in the
[Department of Statistics](http://www.stat.purdue.edu/), [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu/).

Find it difficult to pronounce my name? Well, just treat "x" as "sh" and "Q" as
"Ch", something like [iʃʊən tʃəʊ].

I graduated from [Renmin University of China](http://en.ruc.edu.cn/), where I obtained B.A. and M.A. in 
Statistics and Actuarial Science. There I stayed for six years in the city
of Beijing. That's a good memory.

I'm presently doing research on Functional Data Analysis, and also have great interest
in statistical computing, machine learning and data visualization.
The [Projects]({{ BASE_PATH }}/projects.html) page
lists some open source software and other projects that I have done or am working on.

As you will see, I'm pretty much a useR, since R is so naturally connected with Statistics.
And apart from this, I also keep an eye on some other open source projects and programming languages,
some of which are useful in statistical computing, and others are simply for fun.
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a nice place to find these stuffs,
and even this blog is open source hosted in my [GitHub page](https://github.com/yixuan).

You can always reach me through email, [yixuanq [at] gmail [dot] com](#). Feel free to send
me emails or leave comments here.

I'm Yixuan Qiu, currently a second-year PhD student in the
[Department of Statistics](http://www.stat.purdue.edu/), [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu/).

Find it difficult to pronounce my name? Well, just treat "x" as "sh" and "Q" as
"Ch", something like [iʃʊən tʃəʊ].

I graduated from [Renmin University of China](http://en.ruc.edu.cn/), where I obtained B.A. and M.A. in 
Statistics and Actuarial Science. There I stayed for six years in the city
of Beijing. That's a good memory.

When asked about my research interest, I'm likely to reply that it is
a [random variable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable),
with relatively higher [densities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function)
on computational statistics, machine learning, nonparametric statistics and
data visualization. OK, it's just a "statistical" joke. :-)

In many aspects I'm a useR and loveR. For me R is used for everything related to
Statistics ([a.s.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely)).
I'm also the maintainer of several [R packages](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/).
As a result, you may see that R appears frequently in my blogs.

Apart from R I'm interested in many other open source projects and programming
languages. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a nice place to find these stuffs,
and even this blog is open source hosted in my [GitHub page](https://github.com/yixuan).

You can always reach me through email, [yixuanq [at] gmail [dot] com](#). Feel free to send
me emails or leave comments here.

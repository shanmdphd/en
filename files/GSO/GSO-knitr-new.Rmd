## What is Dynamic Document? {.build}

Recall how you finished a STAT 526 Homework:

> - Type in something about your idea
- Write a piece of code
- Run the code to get output and graph
- Copy and paste them to your document processor
- Repeat steps above

Can we make life a little bit easier?

> - Human language and code in the same document
- Code can be excuted and replaced by its output
- Focus more on content, less on format

## Tools

Early stage -- Sweave

- To "weave" S
- Developed by R Core, very powerful

Today -- knitr

- To "knit" R
- Pronounced as "neater", and neater indeed
- Developed by [Yihui Xie](http://yihui.name/), even more powerful (almost surely)
- [http://yihui.name/knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr)

## Structure

![](images/structure.png)


## Most useful options (output)

- Default option, show both source code and output
```{r eval=FALSE}
<<>>=
x <- seq(1, 6, by = 0.5)
x
sin(x)
@
```
- Show R source code only
```{r eval=FALSE}
<<eval=FALSE>>=
@
```
- Show code output only
```{r eval=FALSE}
<<echo=FALSE>>=
@
```


## Most useful options (output)

- Whether to format the code or not
```{r eval=FALSE}
<<tidy=FALSE>>=
x<-                 seq(1,6,
    by=0.5)
x
@
```
- Only evaluate the code, do not show anything. Mainly used to create variables for later use.
```{r eval=FALSE}
<<include=FALSE>>=
dat = rnorm(100)
@
```


## Most useful options (plot)

- Figure width and height (in R side)
```{r eval=FALSE}
<<fig.width=6, fig.height=6>>=
plot(density(dat))
@
```
- Figure width and height (in output document side)
```{r eval=FALSE}
<<out.width='0.7\\textwidth'>>=
plot(density(dat))
@
```
- Alignment and caption
```{r eval=FALSE}
<<fig.align='center', fig.cap="A density plot">>=
plot(density(dat))
@
```

## From $\LaTeX$ to Markdown {.build}

$\LaTeX$ is a powerful language to write document, but...

> - Not easy to get started
- Complicated, typing too many commands
- Restricted output file format (mainly for PDF)

Another friend of knitr â€“ Markdown

> - So... another language to learn?
- Yes, but...
- Much, much, much easier than $\LaTeX$
- Can be converted into $\LaTeX$, HTML, Word etc.


## An overview of Markdown+knitr

![](images/markdown.png)


## Markdown basics

- Headers
```{r eval=FALSE}
## Methodology 
In this section we introduce our methodology.

### Algorithm
The algorithm is blablabla...

### Simulation
Now we show our simulation result.
```
- Similar to `\section{}` and `\subsection{}` in $\LaTeX$


## Markdown basics
- Decorations (bold, italic, etc.)
```{r eval=FALSE}
You should **NEVER** claim to _accept_ a null hypothesis

You just say **_do not reject_**
```
- Rendered result

You just say **_do not reject_**


## Markdown basics

- Code
```{r eval=FALSE}
There is some inline code: `print(x)`

And code blocks:
`` `
x <- rnorm(100)
summary(x)
`` `
```
- Rendered result

There is some inline code: `print(x)`

And code blocks:
```
x <- rnorm(100)
summary(x)
```

## Markdown basics

- Math formulas
```{r eval=FALSE}
The series $\sum_i \frac{1}{n}$ is divergent, i.e.,
$$\sum_i \frac{1}{n}=\infty$$
```
- Rendered result

The series $\sum_i \frac{1}{n}$ is divergent, i.e.,

$$\sum_i \frac{1}{n}=\infty$$


## Markdown basics

- Item lists
```{r eval=FALSE}
There are three kinds of lies:

- Lies
- Damned lies
- Statistics
    - Frequentists
    - Bayesian
```

## More expressive, more impressive

- 3-D interactive plots
    - [Demo](knitr-webgl.html)
- Animation
    - [Demo](knitr-animation.html)
- Slides
    - Did I tell you this slide was written using Markdown+knitr?
- More data analysis reports at [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/)
- More visualization examples at [Vistat](http://vis.supstat.com/)

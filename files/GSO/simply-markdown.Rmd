## 2. Second part, about statistics

You should **NEVER** claim to _accept_ a null hypothesis.

You just say **_do not reject_**.

## 3. Coding
The code to calculate sum is `sum(x)`

If you want to write a loop
```
s = 0
for(i in 1:length(x))
{
    s = s + x[i]
}
```

## 4. Math
The series $\sum_i \frac{1}{n}$ is divergent, i.e.,
$$\sum_i \frac{1}{n}=\infty$$

## 5. Lies
There are three kinds of lies:

- Lies
- Damned lies
- Statistics
    - Frequentists
    - Bayesian

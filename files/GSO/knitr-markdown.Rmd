This is an _R Markdown_ document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Markdown also supports lists like

- The time when compiling this document is `r as.character(Sys.time())`
- It is a `r lubridate::wday(Sys.time(), label=TRUE, abbr=FALSE)`
    - The `r lubridate::yday(Sys.time())`-th day of this year

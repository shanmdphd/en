## Open source software

Here lists some open source software written or maintained by me, mostly R packages.

### Functional data analysis

- [fdaplus](https://github.com/yixuan/fdaplus): A faster and redesigned
implementation of the [fda](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fda/index.html)
package, which is a broadly used R package in the field of functional data analysis.

### Computing and machine learning

- [rARPACK](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rARPACK/index.html):
An R wrapper of the [ARPACK](http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/) software
used to calculate a small number of eigenvalues or eigenvectors of a matrix in an efficient way.
It also provides functions to compute partial SVD, on both dense and sparse matrices.
- [recosystem](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/recosystem/index.html):
An R wrapper of the [LIBMF](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libmf/) library
for recommender system, using matrix factorization.

### Graphics and data visualization

- [showtext](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/showtext/index.html):
An R package to help use system fonts in R graphics.
- [R2SWF](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R2SWF/index.html):
Convert R graphics to Flash animation, or directly create Flash animations
using plotting commands.

## Document

- [Rcpp-note](http://statr.me/rcpp-note/): An API reference of the
[Rcpp](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) package,
an interface between R and C++ for high performance computing in R.
